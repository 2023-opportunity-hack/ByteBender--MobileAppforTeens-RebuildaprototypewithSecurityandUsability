SafeSpace is a mobile application project aimed at addressing dating violence among teens. 

## Introduction
Our primary goal is to enhance the app by implementing new features, resolving bugs, and redesigning the user interface (UI). Additionally, we are enhancing app's security. We are overhauling the App UI by developing it within Flutter Native rather than FlutterFlow, which will make it easier to update the UI in the future. We are implementing robust security measures like data encryption using hushh algorithm to safeguard sensitive user data stored on Firebase.

## Motivation
We were really inspired by the problem statement. Especially the fact that the app promotes safety among teenagers who face dating violence and other security problems. With a strong belief that we can revamp the app, we completely overhauled the app, adding more features, while keeping all the older features intact.

## Challenges
- Convert the FlutterFlow to Flutter Native so that nobody has to go to Flutterflow and redo the UI every time an update/change is made. See New Figma design.
- Encrypt all the data stored in the app and on Firebase or somehow incorporate blockchain to secure the data.

## New Features
- Create the chatroom in the form of a forum-style screen.
- Retrieve information of nearby shelters and show all the locations on a map.
- Find video resources on YouTube and implement some kind of player in-app.
